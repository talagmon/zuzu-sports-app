# Security Guidelines for ZuzSports App

## 🔐 Environment Variables Security

### ✅ What We've Implemented:

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data moved to `.env` files
2. **Git Protection**: `.env` files are in `.gitignore` - never committed to version control
3. **Secure Configuration**: Environment validation and safe logging
4. **Production Ready**: Separate configs for development/staging/production

### 🚨 Critical Security Rules:

#### **NEVER DO:**
- ❌ Hardcode API keys in source code
- ❌ Commit `.env` files to Git
- ❌ Share API keys in chat/email/Slack
- ❌ Log sensitive data to console in production
- ❌ Store secrets in client-side code for production apps

#### **ALWAYS DO:**
- ✅ Use environment variables for all secrets
- ✅ Use different API keys for dev/staging/production
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ✅ Monitor API usage for suspicious activity
- ✅ Use server-side proxy for sensitive API calls in production

## 🛡️ Current Security Setup:

### Environment Files:
```
.env                 # Local development (never commit)
.env.example         # Template (safe to commit)
app.config.js        # Expo configuration with env vars
src/config/environment.ts  # Secure config management
```

### Protected Data:
- Cloudinary API Key & Secret
- Database connection strings
- Third-party service keys
- Analytics tokens

## 🚀 Deployment Security:

### For Fly.io:
```bash
# Set secrets on Fly.io (not in code)
fly secrets set CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_key_here
fly secrets set CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### For Expo/EAS:
```bash
# Set secrets in EAS
eas secret:create --scope project --name CLOUDINARY_API_KEY --value your_key_here
```

### For Production Apps:
- Use server-side API proxy
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add request authentication
- Monitor API usage patterns

## 📱 Client-Side Security Notes:

⚠️ **Important**: In React Native apps, environment variables are bundled into the app and can be extracted by determined attackers.

### For Maximum Security:
1. **Use Server Proxy**: Create a backend API that handles Cloudinary calls
2. **API Gateway**: Use services like AWS API Gateway or Cloudflare Workers
3. **Signed URLs**: Generate signed URLs on your server
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user API limits

### Current Implementation:
- Environment variables protect against casual exposure
- Suitable for development and internal testing
- For production, consider implementing server-side proxy

## 🔄 Key Rotation:

### Monthly Tasks:
1. Generate new Cloudinary API keys
2. Update environment variables
3. Deploy with new keys
4. Revoke old keys

### Emergency Rotation:
If keys are compromised:
1. Immediately revoke compromised keys in Cloudinary dashboard
2. Generate new keys
3. Update all environments
4. Monitor for unauthorized usage

## 📊 Monitoring:

### Watch For:
- Unusual API usage spikes
- Requests from unexpected locations
- Failed authentication attempts
- Bandwidth usage anomalies

### Tools:
- Cloudinary usage dashboard
- Server logs analysis
- API monitoring services
- Security scanning tools

## 🆘 Security Incident Response:

If you suspect a security breach:
1. **Immediately** revoke all API keys
2. Generate new keys
3. Review access logs
4. Update all deployments
5. Monitor for continued unauthorized access
6. Consider implementing additional security measures

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential for maintaining a secure application.
